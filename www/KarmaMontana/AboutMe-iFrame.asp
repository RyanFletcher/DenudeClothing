    <p>Hello bitches it’s Karma Montana. I’m a half italian, half Caribbean 5' 5" model of perfection. It’s true that I am arrogant, self centred, cocky, materialistic and bitchy, but this does not mean that I am some airhead brat. If you think I’m just a beauty without a brain you are gravely mistaken. I’m intelligent, intelligent enough to know how to use the looks I was blessed with to manipulate, con & persuade men (and even women) into giving in to my desires and sacrificing their pride and pay check for my selfish benefit.</p>
	<p>There is really no difference between how men speak to me on a website like this and how men speak to me in my personal life. Men always beg for my attention and usually resort to showering me with gifts in an attempt to gain it. So when I say I’ve been a Findom before I knew of the word, I hope you understand I’m telling you the truth.</p>
	<p>The funny thing is, even though you know what I’m about, you’ll still spend on me & you’ll still spoil me to fulfil your fetish. I understand that being a financial slave can be addictive and very damaging to your personal life… and I don’t care, I show no remorse exploiting you. You can try as hard as you like but your fetish is irreversible …. it’s like a spell… so once I get a hold of you.. you're mine forever.</p>
	<p>I am not some piece of meat that can be bought, so don’t expect to see me in my underwear or in any sexual poses. I don’t need to do that. Your gratification will come from knowing that your hard earned money is in the hands of a beautiful Bossy Bitch who you’d never have a romantic chance in hell with, you want me to live like a princess, you want to see me rich and successful while you and your family suffers in poverty. Yes you’ll feel like shit when your living off bread and tap water and you have no heating, I’m no longer giving you attention because you don’t get paid for another 3 weeks and you can’t treat your wife to a birthday gift all because I wanted to go shopping and decorate my house. Seeing me successful and superior will be worth it all.</p>
	<p>It’s a vicious cycle, The more you tribute, the richer I get, the stronger the attraction and the more you tribute. It’s over now. You're officially owned!</p>
